[hooks]
; Note that hooks are called asynchonously!

; Arguments to the session.{up,pre-down,down} hooks are as follows:
;
;    <tunnel_id> <session_id> <interface> <mtu> <endpoint_ip> <endpoint_port> <local_port>
;
; Arguments to the session.mtu-changed hook are as follows:
;
;    <tunnel_id> <session_id> <interface> <old_mtu> <new_mtu>
;

; Called after the tunnel interface goes up
session.up=/srv/tunneldigger/broker/scripts/addif_domain{{item.key}}.sh
; Called just before the tunnel interface goes down
; (However, due to hooks being asynchonous, the hook may actually execute after the interface was
; already removed.)
session.pre-down=/srv/tunneldigger/broker/scripts/delif_domain{{item.key}}.sh
; Called after the tunnel interface goes down
session.down=
; Called after the tunnel MTU gets changed because of PMTU discovery
